Hello. Thanks for taking out time to read this. Unfortunetly I couldn't complete my project but I definetly am much better than what I was at the beginning.
I know there has been a bit a backlash from a few students but I really did enjoy the learning curve. You guys pushed us to complete our projects on time which in turn made us more
productive. 
You are relatively new as well as a company, so I am sure as time goes on, you'll get bigger and better from here on out. Also, I'll definetly complete my project in my own time.
Thank you for having me.

P.S. This is not a flattery message just because I couldn't complete my project but just a bit appreciation for you lot. Trust me, it was definetly worth the time and money. 
Thanks once again. 

See ya !

P.P.S. I did try a lot of things in the project but I am just submitting it where you can just skim through the web pages, which is not a lot. The other files are present in the repo though.
